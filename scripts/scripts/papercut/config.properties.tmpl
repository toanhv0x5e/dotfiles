# The optional settings below can be enabled by removing the # from the start  #
# of the relevant line.  These options can also be specified on the command    #
# line.  Any command line options set will override the values set here.       #

# When enabled, debugging information is written to user-client.log
#
#debug=Y

# The silent option tells the client not to report errors if it has problems
# connecting to the server.  If the server is unavailable at time of startup
# (e.g. the client is not connected to the network), or if the user does not
# currently exist in the database, the client will simply sleep waiting for the
# condition to change.
#
#silent=Y

# The minimized option tells the client to start minimized.  On Windows, the
# client will be minimized to the task tray.
#
#minimized=Y

# Configure the client to never display the "confirm identity" dialog if the
# user account does not in the database.
#
#neverrequestidentity=Y

# The noquit option stops the user from closing/quitting the client.
# (Windows only)
#
# Apple Mac: Use a Login Hook to stop users exiting the client. See 'Services
# for Users -> User Client Deployment' in the manual for more information.
#
#noquit=Y

# The "disabletasktrayicon" option instructs the client to not use the system
# task tray.  This has two effects:
#     1. It prevents the client from minimizing to the tray.
#     2. Messages are displayed as standard dialog boxes rather than as task
#        tray notifications.

# The "hide-balance" option instructs the client to hide the balance display. 
#
# On Windows the balance window is not displayed. On other platforms the 
# the balance is hidden from the balance window.
#
#hide-balance=Y

# Disabling task tray support may be useful if the task tray has been removed
# for security reasons using Group Policy Editor.
#
# This is a Windows-only option.
#
#disabletasktrayicon=Y

# The "disable-balloon-tips" option instructs the client to display 
# messages in dialog boxes rather than notification area balloon tips. 
#
# This may be required to display notifications successfully if balloon tips
# have been disabled in Windows.
#
# This is a Windows-only option.
#
#disable-balloon-tips=Y

# The user option allows the client to be run using a different username.
#
# This can be useful if the user is logged into a machine with a different
# username than he or she is authenticated to the server/printers as.  For
# example, if a user is using a laptop that is not a part of the domain.
#
#user=guest

# Specify where the client window should appear. The valid options include
# top-left, top-right, bottom-left or bottom-right.
#
# In addition to the above set of fixed positions, co-ordinates of the window
# can also be specified by setting the <position> parameter to XY<x>,<y>. The
# <x> value sets the x co-ordinate of the window (if negative the value
# indicates the distance from the right of screen). The <y> value sets the y
# co-ordinate of the window (if negative the value indicates the distance from
# the bottom of screen). Some examples include:
#
# Position the window 100 pixels from the left and 100 pixels from the top of
# the screen.
#windowposition=XY100,100
# Position the window 50 pixels from the right and 50 pixels from the top of the
# screen.
#windowposition=XY-50,100
# Position the window 50 pixels from the left and 100 pixels from the bottom of
# the screen.  
#windowposition=XY50,-100
# Position the window in the top left of screen.
#windowposition=top-left

# Allows the window title to be customized. If the title includes {0} then
# this will be replaced by the user's username.
#
#windowtitle=Balance for {0}

#   selection popup will be blank on every popup 
# - if not specified/commented out the account pin field will show the 
#   account pin remembered from the previous popup

# The "disable-gui-effects" option instructs the client to turn off
# some of the advanced GUI effects such as transparent windows and
# fading images.  This may improve performance on very old systems.
#
#disable-gui-effects=Y

# The "lockdir" option defines the directory where the client lock
# file is created.  The lock file is used by the client to ensure that
# each user only runs the client once.  The lock files are usually stored
# in the user's home directory with file names matching the format:
#      .uc-<hash>.<username>.<workstation>.tmp
#
# NOTE: User '\\' for path separators on Windows
#
# Example: lockdir=C:\\temp\\
#
#lockdir=

# authentication method to user/password instead of ID Number.
#
#disable-auth-by-id-number=Y

# The "use-strict-ssl-verification" is used to enable strict checking of SSL
# certificates used to connect to the application server.  This includes both
# hostname and certificate authority trusts.

# If enabling this option you MUST have an officially signed certificate
# installed on the application server, and use the server's DNS name in both
# the "server-ip" and "server-name" settings.
#
#use-strict-ssl-verification=Y
